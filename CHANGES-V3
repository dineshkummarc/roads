- initial implementation of fragment caching:
 * option cacheDuration both global, application level and functor level
 * Example:
fun {$ Session}
 cached(id:Name %% a name that must have been created on functor level
        duration:MilliSeconds %% default: as in functor or application or global
        expire:Cell %% optional; a cell which initially should contain a "skip" procedure;
                    %% when called, will expire the cache fragment
        fun {$}
	  ...contents... %% without anything that is not suitable for caching (no check implemented yet)
        end
    )
end
