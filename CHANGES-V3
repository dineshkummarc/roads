- implementation of fragment caching:
 * option cacheDuration both global, application level and functor level
 * Example:
fun {$ Session}
 cached(id:Name %% optional; a feature (as in dictionaries)
        duration:MilliSeconds %% default: as in functor or application or global
        fun {$ Expire} %% Expire: when bound to unit, expire this fragment
	  ...contents... %% without anything that is not suitable for caching (no check implemented yet)
        end
    )
end
