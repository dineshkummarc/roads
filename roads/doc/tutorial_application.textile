h2. Application Development

Up to now, we have only dealt with small examples which contained one or two functions. Real applications typically consist of a number of modules. We will show how to structure such applications.<br>
Real applications also distinguish between a _model_ which contains the application data and business logic, and one or more _views_ which present the data to the user. The code in the <code>action</code> handlers, <code>bind</code> procedures and <code>validate</code> functions can be considered part of the _controller_: the glue code which handles user input and typically calls functions of the model layer. We will present two approaches how to do this with Roads.<br>
For long running applications, it can be important to be able to update the code without any service interruption. This is very easy to implement with Roads.


h3. Application Configuration

As an example for this chapter, we introduce a simple poll application. This application has two types of users: admins and normal users. Both normal users and admin may vote on polls. But only admins can create and delete polls and designate new admins.

h4. Installation

If you did not clone the complete Git-repository in the first chapter, you need to download and unpack two packages to try out the example application:

# "db-0.2.0.zip":http://github.com/wmeyer/roads/downloads/db-0.2.0.zip: a simple in-memory database system whhich is used by the example application
# "pollapp-0.2.0.zip":http://github.com/wmeyer/roads/downloads/pollapp-0.2.0.zip: the application itself

Build both packages with <code>./build.sh</code> in their respective directory.

To start the application, feed <code>/pollapp/OPI.oz</code> in the Mozart OPI and go to "http://localhost:8080/poll":http://localhost:8080/poll.

- introduce example poll app
- download db and pollapp (if you did not clone the whole repo)

- show and explain parts of PollApp.oz; explain app level configs and before, after
- explain differenz OPI.oz and standalone.oz
