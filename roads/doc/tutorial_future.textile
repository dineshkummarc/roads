h1. Future Development

Features planned for future Roads releases:

* Caching (fragment caching; page caching for pages without generated urls)
* A plugin system which will allow:
** URL rewriting
** custom tags
** better support for non-HTML
* A component system which manages issues that are global to a page (i.e. JavaScript dependencies).
* Deploy on multiple processors / multiple machines.
* Making Roads work with other webservers / https.
